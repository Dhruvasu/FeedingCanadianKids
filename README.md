# Feeding Canadian Kids: Unified Platform for Services
## Description 
Our product is a mobile-friendly website that will provide a centralized platform for registration and communication between Feeding Canadian Kids (FCK) staff, restaurants, and programs.

Presently, there are several existing problems: An immense amount of resources are spent communicating between Program and Restaurant Partners to ensure that all parties involved have agreed upon and are clear about the goals, tasks, locations, etc. There is currently no central platform and it is not always easy for all parties to communicate in an efficient and organized manner.

The mobile-friendly website will centralize communication and management tasks to enable FCK to spend less time managing and communicating with partners, and more time expanding the project nationally. Additionally, our product will provide partners with synchronized, up-to-date, and relevant information that they need for their operations.


## Key Features
With the help of our website, prospective partners and restaurants will have a streamlined application process. Some key features are as follows:

- FCK staff will have an organized and centralized hub to keep track of current and prospective partnersâ€™ statuses and details.

- FCK staff to review applications and make pair restaurants with programs based on the information provided in their applications.

- Once approved and registered, partners can view their information and obligations by logging on to their profile on the website.

### Functionality Testing Directions
##### Program/Restaurant Partner registration and log in functionality:
The following instructions are for a prospective restaurant partner, but steps are almost identical for program partners. Specific instructions for program partners are omitted. 
+ To register as a prospective restaurant partner:
	+ Click on ``Login/Register`` in the upper right corner in the navigation bar.
	+ Click on ``Register as a Program``.
	+ Fill in the fields.
	+ Click ``Submit`` at the bottom of the page.
	+ You are now registered. Your status is still non-active until an admin approves your application and pairs you with a program partner. 
+ To log in:
	+ Click on ``Login/Register`` in the upper right corner in the navigation bar.
	+ Fill in email and password in the fields. Use what you entered for **Restaurant Email** in your application as email.
	+ Click ``Login``
	+ The navbar should be updated to show your email address once signed in. You should be automatically directed to your "Restaurant User" page. Information you can see may be limited due to your inactive status. In this iteration, there is hardcoded dummy data as placeholders until full frontend and backend integration is complete. 
	+ Your login should be persistent, i.e. reloading the website or navigating to a different page should keep you logged in until you log out.
+ To log out:
	+ Click on your email in the upper right corner in the navigation bar.
	+ A dropdown menu should give you the option to log out. Click ``Log Out``
	+ You are now logged out and you should be automatically redirected to the log in page.
