## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?
 
Our product is a mobile-friendly website that will provide a centralized platform for registration and communication between FCK staff, restaurants, and programs.

The mobile-friendly website will centralize communication and management tasks to enable FCK to spend less time managing and communicating with partners, and more time expanding the project nationally. Additionally, our product will provide partners with synchronized, up-to-date, and relevant information that they need for their operations. 

Presently, there are several existing problems: An immense amount of resources are spent communicating between Program and Restaurant Partners to ensure that all parties involved have agreed upon and are clear about the goals, tasks, locations, etc. There is currently no central platform and it is not always easy for all parties to communicate in an efficient and organized manner. 

With the help of our website, prospective partners and restaurants will have a streamlined application process. Some common use cases are as follows:
 - FCK staff will have an organized and centralized hub to keep track of current and prospective partners’ statuses and details. 
 - FCK staff can approve certain fields of the application and provide feedback through the website, and applicants will be automatically informed about their status. Applicants can also check the progress of their application on a single page. 
 - Once approved and registered, partners can view their information and obligations by logging on to their profile.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?
   
+ Restaurant Partners:
  - Restaurants that work closely with FCK staff members and use the Uber Eats app to accept orders from program partners. 
+ Program Partners: 
  - After school programs for children that the project serves. 
  - Although program partners use the Uber Eats app to place orders, verify payment profiles, confirm address selection, etc., there is also a great amount of back-and-forth between FCK and the program partners to ensure that weekly orders are received on time.
+ Prospective Restaurant Partners: 
  - Restaurants that want to become Restaurant Partners and support underprivileged children.
  - Restaurants that have lots of leftovers they want to donate instead of just throwing it away.
+ Prospective Program Partners: 
  - After school programs with an identified need for a nutritious dinner delivery service that are seeking such services.
+ Feeding Canadian Kids Staff:
  - Feeding Canadian Kids staff who manages the daily operations such as verification, restaurant and program matching, and screening.

See User Stories for details about their needs.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
    
The current system uses Google Forms to accept applications responses, staff members then use Microsoft Excel to manually record potential partners’ responses separately. FCK staff members then manually contact applicants individually to provide them next steps in the approval process. Restaurants and Programs do not have a way to easily access up-to-date information about their partner.
+ There will be automated emails that detail the verification/screening/approval process and timeline. Automating part of the application process will significantly reduce the time and effort of FCK staff members and allow the FCK team to process applications more quickly, improving the scalability of the project. 
+ There will be registration forms that partners can use to register. The forms will help to reduce manual efforts by capturing and recording directly through the website in a streamlined manner, completely automatically. 
+ With a central platform that stores all relevant information about restaurants and programs on a database, FCK staff can easily query, sort, and update such information in one place.
+ Restaurant Partners can view the number of meals they need to provide, at what time, to which location in one place. Currently, restaurants rely on reminders from FCK staff or need to keep track of such information on their own, locally. Our website will make sure this information is easily viewable and synchronized between programs and restaurants.
+ Program Partners can view how many meals they can still request, at what time, and from which restaurant. Currently, programs rely on reminders from FCK staff or need to keep track of such information on their own, locally. Our website will make sure this information is easily viewable and synchronized between programs and restaurants.

Overall, our product as mentioned above will lessen the manual workload of FCK staff, allowing them to focus less on micro management of numerous different local documents, and more on expansion of the project to those in need.
