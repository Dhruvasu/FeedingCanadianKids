# Feeding Canadian Kids: Unified Platform for Services

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

Our product is a website that will provide a centralized platform for registration and communication between Feeding Canadian Kids (FCK) staff, restaurants, and programs.

Presently, there are several existing problems: An immense amount of resources are spent communicating between Program and Restaurant Partners to ensure that all parties involved have agreed upon and are clear about the goals, tasks, locations, etc. There is currently no central platform and it is not always easy for all parties to communicate in an efficient and organized manner.

Our web application will centralize communication and management tasks to enable FCK to spend less time managing and communicating with partners, and more time expanding the project nationally. Additionally, our product will provide partners with synchronized, up-to-date, and relevant information that they need for their operations.

## Key Features
With the help of our website, prospective partners and restaurants will have a streamlined application process. Some key high level features are as follows:

- FCK staff will have an organized and centralized hub to keep track of current and prospective partners’ statuses and details.

- FCK staff can review applications and pair restaurants with programs based on the information provided in their applications.

- Prospective restaurants and after school programs can apply to join Feeding Canadian Kids through an easy and intuitive process on the website. 

- Once approved and registered, partners can view their information and obligations by logging on to their profile on the website.

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * If you cannot deploy your application for technical reasons, please let your TA know at the beginning of the iteration. You will need to demo the application to your partner either way.
