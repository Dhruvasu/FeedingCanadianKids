## Iteration 3

 * Start date: November 14th, 2019
 * End date: December 1st, 2019


### Changes from `product.md`
 
#### Mobile Friendliness
We decided to not focus on making the website mobile-friendly due to time constraints. It still works on mobile but the UI can get clunky sometimes, but it works well with all needed functions on PC. And we believe that it is of higher value to have more functions done than to spend a lot of time making it mobile-friendly.

#### Import and Export
We decided to add an import and export CSV files feature for the admin. This allows the admin to export the programs/restaurants as a CSV file and edit it locally and upload the new one. We were hoping to make an interface for the admin to edit the programs/restaurants on the site but we had a time constraint so we decided to opt for this.
In addition, this also adds to the ability of our partner to keep a stable copy of the database which makes them feel much safer.

#### Change Password
We decided to add the feature to change passwords because Rebecca (our project partner) requested us to do so. This also benefits our users just in case they feel like they need a password change.

#### Newly registered programs/restaurants approval process
We were unable to implement the feature that allows FCK staff to approve certain fields of the application and provide feedback through the website. We were also unable to automatically inform applicants of their application status automatically. We did not have enough time to implement this feature.

#### Automated Emails
We planned to have automated emails that detail the verification/screening/approval process and timeline.
However, due to time constriants we are unable to implement this feature. We notified our project partner about this issue and she said that it was okay and we could disregard this feature entirely.

#### Confirm Delivery
Unfortunately we did not have sufficient time to implement this feature. Originally we planned to have the program partner be able to confirm the delivery so the restaurant could be notified. As of right now the only way the restaurant knows the food was delivered is through the courier or calling the program partner.

### Handoff plan
Yes, we are going to have a handoff meeting after the presentation. We will discuss the features that our product currently has. We are handing over the entire codebase in a USB stick to our project partner. Our partner does not have the technical capacity to maintain the product so we also plan to pass some technical notes regarding our codebase and how to maintain it. The notes can be passed on to the future developer that works on the app so that they can get to know our work more easily.
