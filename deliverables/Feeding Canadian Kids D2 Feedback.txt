README.MD: 2

Description: 3
- Meets expectations

Key Features: 2
- Could use more details on details of how you implemented each feature

Instructions: 2
- You should state the requirements of running your application beforehand (i.e. you need to have node, npm and git already installed) 
- Your instructions could be a bit more clear (i.e. I had to find out later on that I need to login as admin and approve requests before I can login as a restaurant or partner)
- You could have orgnaized your instructions better
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deployed App: 3
- Application not deployed for D2 
- In the log in functionality, you state to use a Restaurant Email, but I was not asked to Register as a Restaurant
- Overall, the application has all the features
- Missing some details that might lead to better usability - i.e. there is no back button after the sign up page, missing some pop-ups for confirmation
- Some of your UI (i.e. matching partners and restaurants) is not very intuitive
